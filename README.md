## Topic - Uber Analysis
Our group decided to work and analyze an Uber Driver Data. The Dataset emcompasses of different trip purposes all over the world in 2016. 


## Reason
The reason our group chose this dataset is...

## Discription
For our analysis we've decided to to detemine what places & purpose were the most popular to visit, how many miles has been driven from Start to Stop locations, how much money the driver made each trip and in total for each month or in general. 
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.com https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zusmani/uberdrives

## Questions Datasetwill answer


## Description of the data exploration phase of the project
In order to understand what statistics were available within the dataset, as well as identifying which values would be ideal for the Machine Learning model. After the dataset was downloaded from our source, the team used Excel initially, to skim through the dataset and identify which characteristics of the dataset were preferred as well as locating null values to clean up the data, it was done through Jupyter Notebook. 
At first the dataset were contains only columns below:
* Start Date
* End Date
* Category
* Start 
* Stop
* Miles
* Purpose

## Description of the analysis phase of the project
Final dataset encompassed  16 columns 571 rows 
The remaining columns are:
* Start Date
* End Date
* Category
* Start
* Latitude
* longitude
* Stop
* Latitutude
* Longitude
* Miles 
* Purpose
* $Salary$
* Month
* Day of the week
* Duration
* money - regex


## Technologies Used
 - Git Hub
 - Python
 - Excel
 - Google Slides
 - Jupter Notebook
 - Tableau
 - Aws
 - pgAdmin
 - Pandas
 
 ## Machine Learning Model ??
 
 ## Dashboard
In addition to Juptyer Notebook,Googles Slides, we will also integrate Tableau for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard and Story. It will be hosted on Tableau public.


## Encountered Issues/Solutions
* Before coding with data, salary column were added manually to excel file as: Miles multiply by $2.15 the reason for that because in 2016 NY Uber drivers got paid $2.15 per mile.
* Longitude and Latitude for Start and Stop locations were also added manually with Googleslide extension called "Geocoding with Awesome Table"
